# Device Identifiers Sample
This application will grant permission to access the OEM device identifiers on an A10 device and save the results to an indentifiers.ini file on the sdcard, inside the Downloads folder. The Downloads folder is used in order to ensure compliance with A11 Scoped Storage restrictions.

## Prerequisites
This app will only run on Zebra devices with MX10.1+ & Android 8.1+

## ExamplesUpd
Simply install & run the application - if this is the first time running a dialog will appear asking to grant permissions. Confirm the action on the dialog & the results will be saved to identifiers.ini on the sdcard
